# Machine-Learning-Lab-Task

This project contains solutions to various problem sets related to data science and machine learning.

## Problem Set 01
- The dataset comprises 5,863 JPEG X-Ray images categorised into Pneumonia and Normal types, organised into three folders: train, test, and val.
- The images are chest X-rays (anterior-posterior view) sourced from paediatric patients aged one to five years at a renowned hospital.
- The task is to develop a CNN model to classify medical images into their respective categories.
